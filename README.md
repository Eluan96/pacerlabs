Task

You are tasked with building a simple Next.js application with Redux Toolkit for state management. The application should have a basic login and logout functionality. You will be evaluated on your ability to set up a Next.js project, integrate Redux Toolkit, and implement a clean and organized code structure for handling authentication. Goodluck!
